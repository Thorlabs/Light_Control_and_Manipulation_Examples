## Included Example

### LCC25 simple Python example


The basic example connects to the LCC25, sets a value for Voltage 1 and the output mode to Voltage 1.

The code uses the ctypes library to load the DLL file for these power meters. The ctypes library needs to be installed separately on the computer.

You can find a more extended example in the folder
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Thorlabs\LCC25\Sample\Thorlabs_LCC25_PythonSDK
```
if the LCC25 software is installed.
