## Included Example

### KLC101 simple Python example


The basic example connects to the KLC101, sets a value for Voltage 1, Frequency 1, Voltage 2, Frequency 2, and switches between both.

The file KLCCommandLib64.py is the Python wrapper for 64 bit. It should be saved in the same folder as the example.

The code uses the ctypes library to load the DLL file for these power meters. The ctypes library needs to be installed separately on the computer.

The KLC101 software should be installed.
