## Included Examples

### Deformable_Mirrors_NET
This sample code shows how you can control a Thorlabs DMP40 / DMH40 Deformable Mirror in Matlab.
It connects to a deformable mirror, performs a relaxation and sets voltages for a certain value of a Zernike coefficient. 
The example uses the .NET dlls that have to be installed separately on the computer.
